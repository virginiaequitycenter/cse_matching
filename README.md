# Albemarle County Public Schools Career Self-Efficacy and Outcome Expectations
## Quasi-Experimental Matching Analysis

Building an analysis of how Albemarle 7th and 8th grade students have performed
on the Middle School Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES) in Fall 2023 and 2024 (Fouad et al., 1997)

This analysis matches students in the Starr Hill Pathways program with like peers 
in the ACPS school district using the MatchIt package. This allows us to compare
the progress of the SHP students' career confidence to similar students rather
than to the ACPS population as a whole.
